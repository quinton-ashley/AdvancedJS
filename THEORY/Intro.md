Game Design Fundamentals with p5.play

---

In this course you’ll learn the core principles of game design by making games with p5.play!

p5.play is a 2D game engine for online online games and interactive art.

You probably signed up for this course because you want to know, “How can I make a good video game that people will enjoy playing?”

These lessons will hopefully help you find your own answers to that big question. Let’s get started!

---

So first… What is a game?

Games have structure, usually they have rules and objectives.
Some games are competitions that have winners and losers.

---

Share with the class some things you did when you were a little kid or that you’ve seen other young children doing that could be considered “playing” but not considered games. Did this play activity eventually turn into a game?

Running around -> a game of tag
Climbing things -> a game of who can climb the fastest, highest, etc.
Jumping -> a game of who can jump rope faster/longer
Exploring -> a game of who can find the most of a specific item

Why do humans and other animals engage in play and design games?

Play has a social function, can be used for social bonding
Play improves sensory motor coordination skills
Play stimulates brain development
Play feels fun!

---

What’s the difference between a hard-core vs a casual approach to gaming?

When taking a hard-core approach, players want to be challenged with more complex games they can research and obsess over to optimize their play.
When taking a casual approach, players want to be entertained with games that have a simple premise so they can pick up and play easily.
People don’t exclusively take a casual or hard-core approach to every game they play.

“Instrumental play is a goal-orientated approach that values efficiency, expertise and optimizing strategies as part of play. Crudely put, in instrumental play the point of the playing is not just to reach the end, but to find the best way of getting there (Taylor, 2006). Instrumental play may also be referred to as ‘min-maxing’, ‘power gaming’ or ‘hardcore gaming’. A central feature of this approach is a deep understanding of the game system, which enables one to take advantage of inherent favorable combinations or configurations hidden in the game mechanics, as well as joy in doing so. Instrumental play has received much attention from game studies scholars (eg. Chen, 2012; Eklund & Johansson, 2013; Malone, 2009; Taylor, 2009) as it challenges romantic notions of play as something frivolous, light 5 and enjoyed for its own sake. This tension has also been noted by players who characterize the dedication of power gamers as ‘over the top’. Power gamers are often accused of having no social life outside the game, even for playing incorrectly, by taking the game too seriously. Empirical studies of instrumental power gamers have however shown how they tend to be integral social actors in player communities exactly because of their dedication. In a game where perseverance is a virtue, power gamers are understood as productive and skilled participants whose expertise is sought after and admired (Taylor, 2006). Furthermore, these studies show that a serious approach to play does not exclude fun. Instead enjoyment stem from achieving set goals, finding good strategies and gaining insight into the underlying structures of the game (Consalvo et al., 2010), and serves as a reminder of how games are sites for a wide range of engagements and types of enjoyment (Kallio, Mäyrä, & Kaipainen, 2011).”

Can you think of any “hard-core” gamers who you admire for their intense dedication to a game?

famous athletes (like Olympian Michael Phelps)
famous chess players (like prodigy Magnus Carlson)
e-sports players (like SSB Melee champion HungryBox)

---

Is it always desirable to be good at a game?

No, if people don’t like a game, they won’t want to play it at all!
If people do like a game, it’s often desirable for them to achieve a game’s objectives, even when playing a game “just for fun”. But this isn’t always the case. For example, playing a game poorly on purpose against an inexperienced opponent to teach them how the game is played.

---

Have you ever played a video game that rewards players for being “bad” at it?

Skate 3 is a skateboarding video game that rewards players for completing tricks. It also has a reward system for counting how many bones the player character breaks after a fall! Players can even unlock achievements for really bad falls. Which technically makes it a form of playing the game well, to get all the fall damage achievements you must find the worst places to fall in the game.

“Instrumental play tends towards optimization which can often result in un-fun player behaviors. This gets extended out to the extreme [by the media and some academics], where play framed around challenge or investment is treated as irrational or somehow less genuine than some hypothetically more pure, innocent, unadulterated version of play: unconcerned with doing well. It’s important in this conversation to establish firmly that this is a false dichotomy. [...] they’re not antithetical concepts. Rather than being in conflict with one another they’re in tension, there’s not an opposed relationship but there is a complex one. Because if you back up and think about it, it’s easy to appreciate how someone can find deep enjoyment in improving a skill, achieving goals, and discovering solutions to complex problems. Rather, instrumental play, play focussed on goals, can be juxtaposed with free play. A form of play that is without ending, neither free or instrumental play can exist in their purest form, [...]”

Have you ever engaged in free play with a work of interactive digital art that you wouldn’t categorize as a video game?

When I was in middle school the iPhone was brand new. There were a few apps that gained popularity perhaps only because the 3.5 inch touch screen of the iPhone was such a novel concept. I downloaded an app that displayed a fixed camera top down view of a Koi Pond. Players could tap on the screen to disperse food for the Koi fish and the fish would swim over to eat the food. If you held your finger on the screen

---

Why can't free play exist in its purest form?

humans are natural game designers, we naturally create little games when engaging in free play

---

Share a real life example of a time you “gamified” an banal activity or created a little game for yourself while waiting for something.

What does “being good” at a game even mean? It’s subjective!

In the MW2 clip killing the sniper as fast as possible and moving on to hopefully get another kill to boost one’s killstreak would technically be more optimal play. Yet, since we’re humans and not robots, using opportunities presented by the game world to show off one’s sense of humor can be considered a better way of playing the game.

---

The idea that the “correct” or “best” way to play a game is by achieving the game’s objectives, is a belief that players can choose to adhere to and impose on other players. It’s a value that game designers can try to instill in players, but it is not inherent, natural, or universal amongst players.

---

Share with the class a time you played a game or saw someone else play a game in an innovative or subversive way that the game designers might not have expected.

Example: speed running

“Even though World of Warcraft is built as a system with a formal structure of rules and goals, it is the movement of play between free and instrumental play that makes it difficult if not impossible to see it – or any other game for that matter – as a stable object. This quality of play as movement is not present in prevailing definitions of what constitutes a game, as destabilizing game structures through play makes it even harder to define them. For Malaby, who refers to the destabilizing nature of play as ‘process’, it is reason to argue that ‘any attempt to formalize games by defining them essentially in terms of their rules or through a taxonomy of types [...] falls short because it fails to capture how games are moving targets, capable of generating new, emergent effects that then inform the following instances of the game’ (Malaby 2007: 103). For a game like World of Warcraft, which offers a highly instrumental goal-driven structure of levels, quests and other objectives but, as a virtual world, also presents a space where players can play freely in unpredictable, innovative or subversive manners, the distinction between instrumental and free play is not conceptual but very real. Play in World of Warcraft, then, is not stable but rather the result of constant oscillations between free and instrumental play practices.”

For a more recent example, let's examine Fortnite.

Fortnite matches facilitate instrumental play with modes that have rules and clear objectives.

Contrast that with Fortnite loading areas, in which players can simply exist in a consequence-free limbo with no objective.

Why are Fortnite’s loading areas an example of good game design?

They provide an opportunity for free play in place of a non-interactive loading screen or menu screen.
They enable players to practice new strategies for subsequent instrumental play.
They enable players to make up their own little metagames, games within the game. For example tag, dance battles, and spray paint wars.

We’ll talk more about metagames in another lesson.

What makes a game good?

Risk and Reward!

Metagames

---

Have you ever made up a game within a game?

---

“Metagame, Hypergame, or game about the game, is an approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.”

Metagaming - Wikipedia

---

“play functions as a critical practice [...] players have transformed videogames into platforms for making metagames.”

What is a game’s meta?

Even when a game retains the same rules, new innovations in play styles can develop and spread through a player community, affecting how all players play the game. Adapting one’s own play style to how other players play is referred to as a game’s meta. The meta-game often requires players to master advanced techniques in order to be competitive.

---

Super Smash Bros. Melee, released in 2001, was designed to bring a competitive fighting game experience to young and casual gamers. Yet, Melee was designed so well that the game’s meta grew into a highly competitive e-sport, in which professional players have pushed high level competitions of the game way beyond the game designer’s expectations.

Why do people enjoy playing video games?

Video Games can be played for entertainment
Video Games can be played competitively
Video Games can also be used as creative tools (minecraft worlds that people sell, concerts in fortnite)
