## Coding Philosophy: Iterative Software Development

Solve complex problems by using the iterative development approach!

```
"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step".
```

Plan before you code by dividing the problem into tasks, then divide those tasks into steps. Don't spend too long trying to plan and figure things out all in your head though. Start by implementing the easiest or simplest solution to a complex problem you can think of and build from that.

Sometimes you might need to draw diagrams or work out problems on paper before you start coding. Other times it will be okay to just start writing your code with blind confidence and if you get things wrong at first, test and learn from your mistakes. Test often after adding new code, don't assume something works just because you think it will!

I use the iterative development approach for all of my lessons, including this one. Using it during development will help you make incremental progress and avoid getting stuck.

## Artificial Intelligence in Games

Making an AI for a game, even for TicTacToe, might sound daunting but you already know enough about programming to do it! AI is just code that reacts to a game environment with an action.

Try to think of the simplest method of making a move in Tic Tac Toe. Note it's not the same as the worst method, which would be deliberately making moves to help your opponent win.

In TicTacToe the simplest method to make a valid move is to look at each space and place one's X or O mark in the first available space. Available spaces are spaces that are not already occupied by an X or O. This will be how your easy level AI player will make moves!
